--Task 1 --

Fix the build issue .

Access to be provided soon on this.

Although I have the access but I still have to get KT on   the current state of the project and others


As per Julio and Anil  my work assignment would be to relate to building CI/CD for this project as they have done for SMH and also second point would be to build and deployment ownership okay so that is a part of Dev ops engineer role that's going to be won by me and I have to get the SONAR scans and report  list within a   pipeline and the report should be sent to the teams.


My expectation from the person who is giving KT to meet would be provided the access first of all I meant was that this is done I want to just revisit all the URLs what is the status in SMH and what's how we are connected to different environment of things and as and when it required I'm going to have some queries and resolve them and once I start building

1.Technology used 
2.Different team members
3. Explain the current pipeline in SMS project and expectation on this project
4. Understand the timeline
