Guiding tenets for Work Loads:-

1. Cost optimisation
2. Operational Excellence
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Reliability
5. Security


Cost Optmisation :- 

 Right Resource right Size
 prepare for scale out cost
 monitor and optimize
 
 
 Capture Clear requirement
 Estimate initial costs
 Define policies
 Identify Shared Assets
 Plan a governance strategy
 
 Check resource cost --> chose right subscription --> Chose the right resource -> compare consumption based vs pre-provisioned based -> use POC deployments -> Chose managed services when possible
 
 
 
 Operational Excellence ->
 
1. Devops Methodologies - (more on monitoring through app insights and others later)
2. Separation of roles
 a) Team Collaboration
 b) WorkLoad isolation
3. Operational metadata
  a) optmize build and release process
 4. Monitor and Understand health 
 5. rehearse recovery and understand failure
 6. Embrace ops improvement (through automation mostly)
 7. use losely coupled architecture
 8. Incident Management


Reliability - Key Points

1. Identify Possible Failure points
2. Eliminate all single point of failures
3. Maintain List of Dependancies
4. Understand SLA

Security:-
Align Security principle to mission
Build a Comprehensive Strategy
Drive Simplicity
Design for attackers
Leverage native controls
use identity as PAC
Accountability 
Embrace Automation
Focus on information protection
Design for resilience
Baseline and benchmark
Drive continous improvement
Assume Zero trust!!!

Areas to be considered for security:-

Identity Management (Azure AD)
Protect your Infrastructure
Application Security
Data Sovereignity and Encryption


Important Security Tools - NIST
